abstract = "Variants of the Finite State Machine (FSM) model have been extensively used to describe the behavior of reactive systems. In particular, several model-based testing techniques have been developed to support test case generation from FSMs and test case execution. Most of such techniques require several validation properties to hold for the underlying test models. Featured Finite State Machine (FFSM) is an extension of the FSM model proposed in our earlier publication that represents the abstract behavior of an entire Software Product Line (SPL). By validating an FFSM, we validate all valid products configurations of the SPL looking forward configurable test suites. However, modeling a large SPL using flat FFSMs may lead to a huge and hard-to-maintain specification. In this paper, we propose an extension of the FFSM model, named Hierarchical Featured State Machine (HFSM). Inspired by Statecharts and UML state machines, we introduce the HFSM model to improve model readability by grouping up FFSM conditional states and transitions into abstracted entities. Our ultimate goal is to use HFSMs as test models. To this end, we first define some syntactic and semantical validation criteria for HFSMs as prerequisites for using them as test models. Moreover, we implement an adapted graphical Eclipse-based editor from the Yakindu Project for modeling, derivation, and checking feature-oriented properties using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver tools. We investigate the applicability of our approach by applying it to an HFSM for a realistic case study (the Body Comfort System). The results indicate that HFSMs can be used to compactly represent and efficiently validate the behavior of parallel components in SPLs."

abstract = "Context: Traceability in Software Product Lines (SPL) is the ability to interrelate software engineering artifacts through required links to answer specific questions related to the families of products and underlying development processes. Despite the existence of studies to map out available evidence on traceability for single systems development, there is a lack of understanding on common strategies, activities, artifacts, and research gaps for SPL traceability. Objective: This paper analyzes 62 studies dating from 2001 to 2015 and discusses seven aspects of SPL traceability: main goals, strategies, application domains, research intensity, research challenges, rigor, and industrial relevance. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas calling for further research. Method: To gather evidence, we defined a mapping study process adapted from existing guidelines. Driven by a set of research questions, this process comprises three major phases: planning, conducting, and documenting the review. Results: This work provides a structured understanding of SPL traceability, indicating areas for further research. The lack of evidence regarding the application of research methods indicates the need for more rigorous SPL traceability studies with better description of context, study design, and limitations. For practitioners, although most identified studies have low industrial relevance, a few of them have high relevance and thus could provide some decision making support for application of SPL traceability in practice. Conclusions: This work concludes that SPL traceability is maturing and pinpoints areas where further investigation should be performed. As future work, we intend to improve the comparison between traceability proposals for SPL and single-system development."

It guides the user in setting up dedicated learning scenarios, and invites her to experiment with the available options in order to infer models at adequate levels of abstraction. In the course of this process, characteristics that go beyond a mere ``site map'' can be revealed, such as hidden states that are often either specifically designed or indicate errors in the application logic. Characteristic for ALEX is its support for mixed-mode learning: REST and web services can be executed simultaneously in one learning experiment, which is ideal when trying to compare back-end and front-end functionality of a web application. ALEX has been evaluated in a comparative study with 140 undergraduate students, which impressively highlighted its potential to make formal methods like active automata learning more accessible to a non-expert crowd.",

abstract="The growth of user request for higher software quality has motivated the definition of methods and techniques in order to improve the way software is developed. Several works have investigated a variety of testing criteria in an attempt to obtain a testing strategy with lower application costs and higher efficacy in detecting faults. The aim of this chapter is to present the theoretical and practical aspects related to the software testing activity. A synthesis of functional, structural, and fault-based testing techniques is presented. A comparison of the testing criteria (cost, efficacy, and strength) is also considered from the theoretical and experimental points of view.",

pages="65-105",
abstract="Most of today's software applications feature a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end. System testing of these applications requires that test cases, modeled as sequences of GUI events, be generated and executed on the software. We term GUI testing as the process of testing a software application through its GUI. Researchers and practitioners agree that one must employ a variety of techniques (e.g., model-based, capture/replay, manually scripted) for effective GUI testing. Yet, the tools available today for GUI testing are limited in the techniques they support. In this paper, we describe an innovative tool called GUITAR that supports a wide variety of GUI testing techniques. The innovation lies in the architecture of GUITAR, which uses plug-ins to support flexibility and extensibility. Software developers and quality assurance engineers may use this architecture to create new toolchains, new workflows based on the toolchains, and plug in a variety of measurement tools to conduct GUI testing. We demonstrate these features of GUITAR via several carefully crafted case studies.",

title="Inferring extended finite state machine models from software executions",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2016",
volume="21",
number="3",
pages="811-853",
abstract="The ability to reverse-engineer models of software behaviour is valuable for a wide range of software maintenance, validation and verification tasks. Current reverse-engineering techniques focus either on control-specific behaviour (e.g., in the form of Finite State Machines), or data-specific behaviour (e.g., as pre / post-conditions or invariants). However, typical software behaviour is usually a product of the two; models must combine both aspects to fully represent the software's operation. Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs) provide such a model. Although attempts have been made to infer EFSMs, these have been problematic. The models inferred by these techniques can be non-deterministic, the inference algorithms can be inflexible, and only applicable to traces with specific characteristics. This paper presents a novel EFSM inference technique that addresses the problems of inflexibility and non-determinism. It also adapts an experimental technique from the field of Machine Learning to evaluate EFSM inference techniques, and applies it to three diverse software systems.",
