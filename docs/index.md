## Description

In this repository, we provide the experimental and coding artifacts for the FFSM<sub> Diff</sub> algorithm, a technique to learn featured finite state machines (FFSM) from product-specific finite state machines.
We hope our artifacts are useful to researchers and practitioners willing to explore related work and should be sufficient to replicate our experiments in our particular setting.
