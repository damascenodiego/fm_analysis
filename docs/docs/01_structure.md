# Structure of the repository

- In folder **[FFSM_diff](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff)**, you find the Java project for our project that can be opened using the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide). 

- In folder **[FFSM_diff/lib](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff/lib)**, you find the binaries for some Java libraries used in our Eclipse project 
(e.g., [FeatureIDE](https://featureide.github.io) and [Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)). 
Some libraries (e.g., [LearnLib](https://learnlib.de)) are included using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

- In folder **[FFSM_diff/src](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff/src/)**, you find the source-code of the FFSM_Diff algorithm. 
Essentially, there is one packages (i.e., [uk.le.ac](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff/src/main/java/uk/le/ac)) 
that includes the coding artifacts we developed in our studies.

<small><b>INFO:</b> We recommend to build our project using the [JDK version 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).</small>
