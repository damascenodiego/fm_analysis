# Structure of the repository

- In folder **[FFSM_diff](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff)**, we have the Java project of the FFSM_Diff algorithm. 
  This is an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide) project developed developed using the [JDK version 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

- In folder **[FFSM_diff/lib](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff/lib)**, you find the binaries for some Java libraries used in our Eclipse project 
(e.g., [FeatureIDE](https://featureide.github.io) and [Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)). 
Some libraries (e.g., [LearnLib](https://learnlib.de)) are included using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

- In folder **[docs](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/docs)**, you find the webpage of the FFSM_Diff project.

- In folder **[experiments](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/experiments)**, you find the directories containing the open data artifacts generated from studies using the FFSM_Diff algorithm. 
This folder is organized based on the recommendations by https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32489-6_17.
