# The Featured Finite State Machine Learning project (aka FFSM_Diff)

This repository contains the open source and open data from the Featured Finite State Machine Learning project.
This project is a result of the PhD research of Carlos Diego Nascimento Damasceno at the [Universidade de Sao Paulo](https://www.icmc.usp.br/) under the supervision of 
[Adenilso Simao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gdT5wnMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mohammad Mousavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KtpGCS4AAAAJ&hl=en).

This repository is organized as follows:

In folder **[FFSM_diff](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff)**, we have the Java project of the FFSM_Diff algorithm. 
This project can be opened using the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide) and [JDK version 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

In folder **[Benchmark_SPL](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/FFSM_diff/Benchmark_SPL)**, there is a set of SPLs that can be used as subject systems. These SPLs are available as (F)FSM and FTS models.

In folder **[docs](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/docs)**, you find the webpage of the FFSM_Diff project.


In folder **[experiments](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/experiments)**, you find the directories containing the open data artifacts generated from studies using the FFSM_Diff algorithm.
These sub-folders are organized based on the project structure and naming conventions from https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32489-6_17.

Currently, this project has been used in two studies:

	- [Learning from Difference @ SPLC2019](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/experiments/splc2019)

	- [Learning by Sampling @ EMSE2020](https://github.com/damascenodiego/learningFFSM/tree/master/experiments/emse2020)
